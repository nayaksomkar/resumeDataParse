"""Pydantic schema for structured resume data.

This model is used two ways:
1. As the output schema handed to the LLM via `PydanticOutputParser`, so the
   model knows exactly which fields to produce.
2. As the validation layer that guarantees the parsed result matches the
   expected structure before it is persisted to JSON.
